#' lsa_weights() computes normalized and effective sample size weights for pseudo maximum likelihood mixed models, with large scale assessment data
#'
#' @param data data frame object which contains the rest of the arguments
#' @param id_i a numeric vector of a single variable
#' @param id_j a numeric vector of a single variable
#' @param id_k a numeric vector of a single variable
#' @param wt observations final weight
#' @param wi observations weigth within the primary sampling unit (i.e. students eight within the school)
#' @param wj cluster weights (i.e. school weights)
#'
#' @return the original data frame with the new weights at the end, where `wa1` nad `wa2` are level 1 and level 2 normalized weights; `wb1` nad `wb2` are level 1 and level 2 effectives sample weights.
#'
#' @details a collection of dplyr::mutate sequences to create normalized and effective sample weights (see Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2006; Snijder & Bosker, 2012)

## method 2: normalized weights

# [01] a copy of the total weight
# [02] a square of the total weight
# [03] sum of total weights by schools
# [04] sum of square of total weights by schools
# [05] normalized within weights
# [06] normalized within weights by between raw weight
# [07] fixed mean of previous term (adapted for multiple country and single country datasets)
# [08] normalized between weights

## method 1: effective sample size

# [09] count of cases per cluster
# [10] effective sample size within weight
# [11] effective sample size within weight by between by raw weight
# [12] fixed mean of previous term (adapted for multiple country and single country datasets)
# [13] effective sample size between weight
