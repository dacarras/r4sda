\title{caterpillar_mean_plot() it plots the rank of random effects across clusters, with ther point estimates and their uncertainty (1.96*SD), around it points estimates}
\usage{
caterpillar_mean_plot(mlm_model)
}
\arguments{
\item{mlm_model}{it requires an mlm_model, generated by lme4. If this is a null, the plot display the unconditioned random effect, plus its intercept. If the model is not a null model, then the plot display the expected random effects given the model plus its intercept or grand mean.}
}
\value{
a plot, a `ggplot2` object.
}
\description{
caterpillar_mean_plot() it plots the rank of random effects across clusters, with ther point estimates and their uncertainty (1.96*SD), around it points estimates
}
\details{
Given the return object is a common `ggplot2` user can further customize the figure, overwritting or defining parameter for the plot such as colours, axis lenght, and coord_fixed(ratio=.xx)
